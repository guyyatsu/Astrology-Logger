# Guyyatsu Hikikomori's Astrology Logger.
This was a fun little experiment in scripting the execution of an old Windows95 astrology chart generator; `astrolog`.
PRetty nifty little widget; the script calls the command-line version of `astrolog` three different ways to produce
three different kinds of output, with each kind requiring varying levels of re-structuring before it's left alone in
the filesystem structure.

## Filetype: `horoscope.txt`
## Filetype: `horoscope.table.txt`
## Filetype: `horoscope.chart.bmp`
